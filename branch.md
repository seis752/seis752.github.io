##Branch to create pull request

[Justin](https://github.com/jmcdowell) figured out that you cannot create a pull request from a tag. It needs to be from a branch. So, going forward with HW5 here are the steps:

1. From your master create a new branch.  Called "HW4branch".

2. When you submit your pull request, be sure that you select that branch from the options of your HW4 repository
